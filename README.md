## Before Getting Started
### ***This repository is the only the back-end. The front-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Jarhatz/portfolia-client).**

In this repository, the folder `models` is too large for our Git LFS limit. Please click this [link](https://google.com/) to download a zip file of `models` which you can manually add to this cloned repository. **Note: There should be a total of 7 model checkpoint directories under `models/stockformer`.*

The File Directory Structure of `models`:

Due to unforeseen issues with the `nvwb start jupyterlab` Docker container not recognizing GPUs on our local machine during development, we decided to create our own custom Docker image which can recognize CUDA devices on the host machine. Details for running this application can be found below.

## Getting Started

1) Build the docker image with the Dockerfile present in the root directory of this repository.

**Note: This may take ~5 minutes to build*

```bash
docker build -t portfolia .
```

2) Start a container and run a simple dependency test. The following command will run the test to make sure everything went well.

You should see: `All imports successful. No dependency conflicts.`
```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all portfolia python3 code/run_test.py
```
3) Start the server in a container. It will be listening on port 5000 for any incoming HTTP API requests.
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --gpus all portfolia python3 code/server.py
```

## Start the Front-End
Once the back-end server is up and running, feel free to launch the front-end client web application. Instructions can be found in our [portfolia-client](https://github.com/Jarhatz/portfolia-client) repository.
