Due to unforeseen issues with the `nvwb start jupyterlab` Docker container not recognizing GPUs on our local machine during development, we decided to create our own custom Docker image which can recognize CUDA devices on the host machine. Details for running this application can be found below.

## Getting Started

1) Build our docker image with the Dockerfile present in the root directory of this repository.

**Note: This may take ~5 minutes to build*

```bash
docker build -t portfolia .
```

2) Start a container and make sure to set environment variables to API keys for HuggingFace Hub, NVIDIA NIMs, and Tavily. The following command will run a simple test to make sure everything went well.

You should see: `All imports successful. No dependency conflicts.`
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --gpus all -e HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN=$HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN -e NVIDIA_API_KEY=$NVIDIA_API_KEY -e TAVILY_API_KEY=$TAVILY_API_KEY portfolia python3 code/run_test.py
```
